The goal of this project is to create a sample interactive ad creative for SIMID. 
Our aim is to design a creative using the Google Maps API that provides users a 
map of nearby locations where they could find the advertised product.

This directory contains files for the SIMID creative that will populate the iframe
and send data regarding user interaction to the server.
