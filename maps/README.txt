The goal of this project is to create a sample interactive ad creative for SIMID. 
Our aim is to design a creative using the Google Maps API that provides users a 
map of nearby locations where they could find the advertised product.

The files in this directory include: 
  -simid_protocol.js which defines the protocol for SIMID creatives
